Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
This is the structured application of engineering principles to develop high quality softwares.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of progrmming languages - these are the languages like C that are used for writing instructins that direct a computer on what to do.
2. Raise of a gile methodologies in the 2000s - This is a type of a na pproach that is used in software development that focuses in continuous improvement of software.
3. Establishment of softwaere ingineering as a principle in 1960s - This was a done as a response to the growing complexity of computer systems.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements - This invoves gathering the required items and documenting the user needs.
2. Design - This involves creating a high level design of the user interface.
3. Implementation - This is the part where odes are written in fullfillment of the design process.
4. Testing - This involves conducting various tests to ensure that the software meets the quality statndars and functional requirement.
5. Deployment - This where the software is released into the market.
6. Maintenance - This where support and enhancement of the software is done.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Agile methodology is iterative and incremental wheres waterfall is sequential in software development.
2. agile is more flexible and can easily be changed wheras waterfall is rigid and difficult to change.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. software develeoper - is responsible for writing the sofware codes and implementing the software solutions.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensure the quality of a software by designing and executing test plans.
3. Project Manager - is reponsible for planning and executing of projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. They enhance productivity and collaboaration amond developers by providing them with code editors, version control and debugging tools.
2. IDEs include the Visual Studio Code
3. VCS include the Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing requiremnts, this can be addressed by staying udated withthe latest news of requirements.
2. Tight deadlines, This can be solved by comming up with a plann that that ensures that the development process will be complete by the set deadlines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit tesing - thhis is testing of individual modules
2. Intergration testing - This is testing how the modules interact with each other
3. System testing - This is the testing of the entire system as a whole
4. Acceptance teing -  This is the testing if the system by the user needs
5. this testing methods ensures that bugs are fixed early enough to ensure quality in the software.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the process of crafting statements to gets the betst rersponse from an AI
it helps makes questions clear and specific to enable the Ai to understand what you need


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt
"Tell me about the history"
upgrade
"Tell about the history of maumau war"
